# Latex Document Outline

This package provides an outline of latex documents. It recursively checks `\include` statements and provides links to the appropriate file and line number for `\part`, `\chapter`, `\section`, `\subsection`, and `\subsubsection` commands. It is designed to harmonise nicely with the [atom-latex](https://atom.io/packages/atom-latex) package and has the capability to draw the main file from the `.latexcfg` file.
